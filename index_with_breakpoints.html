                <p>Labour’s plans to move Hove Library down the road to Hove Museum look set to be dealt a near-fatal blow this evening as the Green and Tory parties team up to vote them down. The news comes after the plans were pulled from the agenda of April’s policy and resources committee when Labour learnt that opposition councillors were planning to table an amendment to delay the plans.

                <p>lans to restore the Madeira Terraces and create glass-fronted shops, cafes, offices and even overnight beach huts underneath have been unveiled today. The listed Victorian terraces have been closed since 2013, when a routine survey uncovered structural concerns. Subsequent surveys have uncovered substantial corrosion of the cast iron fixings keeping the 130-year-old structure up, leading to further closures and the relocation of several businesses.

                <p>Parents and children set up a pop-up zebra crossing to protest about a dangerous road outside a Portslade school earlier today (Wednesday 8 June).
                The idea came from parents at St Peter’s Community Primary School who said that they were frustrated that their requests for a safe crossing in busy Church Road kept being turned down. Teachers, parents and pupils at the school hope that the pop-up protest will help to persuade Brighton and Hove City Council to install the real thing.
